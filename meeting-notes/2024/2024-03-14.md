### Agenda

- EasyBuild v5.0.0 release expected in next couple of weeks
    - see also [conf call notes](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/wiki/Conference-call-notes-20240313)
    - RPATH linking by default
    - renaming of easyconfig parameters, EasyBuild configuration options (see [issue #4464](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/issues/4464))
    - complete overview of (breaking) changes will be available at https://docs.easybuild.io/easybuild-v5
    - considering to no longer add stuff to `$PYTHONPATH`, to get more user-friendly behaviour for users creating their own virtualenv ([issue #2887](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/issues/2887))
- OpenSSL/3 on RHEL9
    - UGent is replacing `OpenSSL/1.1` wrapper with `OpenSSL/3` on HREL 9.x to make sure that system is OpenSSL
    - focusing on `foss/2023a` + `foss/2023b` for now
- MPI trouble after updating to recent OFED
    - `Failed to modify UD QP to INIT on mlx5_0: Operation not permitted`
    - see also https://github.com/openucx/ucx/issues/9468
    - seems like a firmware upgrade is needed to fix this issue
    - affects CP2K on Tier-1
    - seems to be connected to specific MPI calls/use cases
    - also seeing hangs with FDS on AMD clusters (may be related)
- PR Ehsan: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/19793
    - Kenneth will test & review
- EasyBuild User Meeting in Sweden (23-25 April 2024) => https://easybuild.io/eum24
