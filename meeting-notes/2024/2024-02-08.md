# Sync meeting 2024-02-08 (09:00 CET)

### Agenda

- Maxime's effort to get GROMACS working on AMD GPUs
    - see [easyconfigs PR #19604](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/19604)
    - uses newer UCX than what's in `foss/2022a`, which is an issue that should be fixed
    - UCX 1.14 is required to be able to create UCX-ROCm
    - there's a development project on LUMI to test ROCm support in EasyBuild (Kenneth, Ã…ke, Kurt)
        - Kenneth will look into adding Maxime to the project
- EasyBuild 5.0
    - EB v4.9.0 end of Dec'23, no more v4.x releases planned, v5.0 should be first release in 2024
    - to test development version of EasyBuild 5.0:
      ```shell
      # set up Python virtual environment, and jump into it
      python3 -m venv eb5
      source eb5/bin/activate

      # install EasyBuild 5.0 development version into it
      pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/archive/5.0.x.tar.gz
      pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/archive/5.0.x.tar.gz
      pip install https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/archive/5.0.x.tar.gz

      # go!
      eb --version
      ```
- PR to vsc-software-stack repo that contained secrets was removed (via GitHub support)
    - can only be requested by repo admins (Alex, Sam, Kenneth)
    - for UA => Robin
    - for KUL => Maxime
- `setuptools-scm` was moved from `hatchling` to `Python` ([easyconfigs PR #19777](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/19777))
    - without having `setuptools-scm` available, Python packages may get installed with `0.0.0` as version
    - => should add missing extensions to recent Python installations via `eb --from-pr 19777 Python-3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0.eb Python-3.11.5-GCCcore-13.2.0.eb --rebuild --skip`
- Alex' [PR for polars](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/19770)
    - older polars version, because latest version requires Rust "nightly" features (see [upstream issue](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/13653))
- OpenSSL 3.x on RHEL9
    - how do we deal with this?
    - start depending on OpenSSL/3 wrapper with newer toolchain (2024a)
        - let EB build OpenSSL 3.x from source on older OSs
        - build OpenSSL 1.1 required by older toolchains from source on RHEL9 ?
    - document solution with hook to replace `OpenSSL/1.1` with `OpenSSL/3` to avoid building `OpenSSL` 1.1.x from source
        - some software may not be compatible yet with OpenSSL 3.x
    - "magic" `OpenSSL/system` dependency?
        - install `OpenSSL/1.1` on CentOS 7.x, RHEL 8.x
        - `OpenSSL/3` on RHEL 9.x
        - probably a PITA to deal with...
