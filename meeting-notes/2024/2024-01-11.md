# Sync meeting 2024-01-11 (09:00 CEST)

### Agenda

- Installing iRODS on Hortense (and other sites?) => easyconfigs are available at https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/pull/244
    - Lara will have a look

- Maxime: updates wrt easybuilding GROMACS for Antwerp's MI100 GPUs; EB pull requests will follow

- Leuven: in the near future we will be (easy)building software for our wICE extension,
          which includes new Intel CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs (with AMD zen4 CPUs) 
    Balasz:
    - difficult to select compilers flags for LLVM Intel compilers to produce optimized code for zen4
    - OpenBLAS only has full zen4 support in the most recent toolchains (>= 2023a)
    - 192 cores per node -> users need to be aware that applications may not scale well to the full node
    Sam: we will also be getting zen4 CPUs in the future
