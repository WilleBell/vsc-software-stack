# Sync meeting 2024-09-12 (09:00 CEST)

attending: Kenneth, Balazs, Robin, Steven, Maxime

* Steven: I encountered an interactive install script that executes `more ${lic_dir}/license_agreement` and `run_cmd_qa` seems to hang on that. Is there a clean way to get past it (other than patching the install script to replace `more` with `cat` for example)?
    * send `'q'` as answer to first couple of words in the output
* EasyBuild v4.9.3 release this week
    * incl. `2024a` toolchains
        * note: using Intel's oneAPI Fortran compiler by default from this version onwards (but classic Fortran compiler is still available)
        * `foss/2024a` incl. OpenMPI 5.x
            * see also https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/major-changes.php
    * very likely to be last EasyBuild 4.x release...
* HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters being migrated to RHEL9
    * was announced to users this week, see https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/rhel9
    * **only software installed with 2023a or newer toolchain will be available on RHEL9**
    * RHEL8 container image will be provided for software that is problematic on RHEL9
        * temporary workaround
        * not documented yet
    * Steven: can use "module load" logs to figure out what to reinstall (and what now)
* update on upcoming EasyBuild 5.0 release
    * progress was a bit stagnant over summer months, but is now back on the rails
        * hard to make a good ETA for actual release of EasyBuild v5.0, but "weeks not months" seems reasonable at this point
    * merged PRs to `5.0.x` branch: [framework](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/milestone/71?closed=1), [easyblocks](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/milestone/73?closed=1), [easyconfigs](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/milestone/72?closed=1)
    * work-in-progress + TODO: see [EasyBuild 5.0 project board](https://github.com/orgs/easybuilders/projects/18/views/2)
    * thorough overview of breaking changes, changed defaults in configuration setting, deprecated functionality, enhancements, etc. will be clear via https://docs.easybuild.io/easybuild-v5 (but isn't yet)
    * webinar will be scheduled shortly after EasyBuild 5.0 release where we'll present changes in detail, and answer questions
