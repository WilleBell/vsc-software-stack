# Sync meeting 2024-05-02 (09:15 CEST)

attending: Steven, Lara, Balazs, Kenneth, Maxime, Alex, Cintia

- previous meeting in April was skipped? (yes)
- decrease frequency of these meetings?
    - once every 2/3 months would be fine
    - can use VSC Slack to signal need for a meeting to discuss something
- EasyBuild 5.0 talk at EUM'24
    - [slides (PDF)](https://users.ugent.be/~kehoste/eum24/003_eum24_easybuild5.pdf)
    - [recording @ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJyEq2k8zss&list=PLhnGtSmEGEQild9FmlP8Qmz9Csc_gOJKF&index=4&pp=gAQBiAQB)
    - run_shell_cmd
    - removed easyblocks (see [merged PRs](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3AEasyBuild-5.0+remove))
    - renaming options/parameters for consistency
        - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/issues/4464
        - will be done gradually, no deprecation warnings (by default) in short term
    - toolchain support policy: https://docs.easybuild.io/policies/toolchains
- 2024a common toolchains
    - waiting for GCC 13.3 release (soon)
    - probably using OpenMPI 5.0.3 in `foss/2024a` (to be tested)
- discussion on easyconfigs for VASP
    - easyconfigs for Wannier90 can be public
    - most of time is spent in FFT, so definitely should use MKL
