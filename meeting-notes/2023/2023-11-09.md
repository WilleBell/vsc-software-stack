# Sync meeting 2023-11-09 (09:00 CEST)

### Agenda

- EasyBuild v4.8.2, see release notes @ https://docs.easybuild.io/release-notes/#release_notes_eb482
- expose unknown configure option warnings
    - see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/3026
    - will become hard error in EasyBuild 5.0, see https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/3025
- control CMake to pick up the right Python
    - see for example https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/18963/files
    - probably need to control this via `CMakeMake`, either by setting options like `-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE`, or by changing the poliy that CMake uses for picking Python (cfr. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.28/policy/CMP0094.html)
- probable roadmap for EasyBuild releases
    - EasyBuild v4.9.0 release before end of 2023 (incl. 2023b common toolchains)
        - last 4.x release
    - EasyBuild v5.0
        - first release of 2024
- toolchain support policy => https://docs.easybuild.io/policies/toolchains
- VUB will migrate to Rocky 8 by end of Nov'23
    - everything before 2022a will be deprecated
    - older software installs for CentOS 7 will still be available, but probably not useful (due to linking to glibc/openssl of CentOS 7)
- at UGent, toolchains older than 2023a will not be supported on AMD Genoa (Zen4, shinx cluster)
    - maybe 2022b if effort is reasonable (probably requires update of OpenBLAS)
    - mainly due to OpenBLAS not being compatible with Zen4 (no correct CPU detection or optimized kernels)
    - compiler in older toolchains don't have support for AVX-512 on AMD Genoa
    - GCC 12.3 or newer is required to support AVX-512 on AMD Genoa (GCC 12.2 does not)
        - with Intel compiler, could consider using `rocketlake` CPU target on AMD Genoa (same supported instructions)
        - ancient compilers don't support `-march=core-avx512`
    - we will move even more towards foss than we already do today, away from intel toolchain
        - some exceptions for Fortran
        - intel toolchain is already a pain today for things like SciPy-bundle
        - may need to use NVHPC toolchain for some Fortran software
        - Fortran compiler (flang) in LLVM 17 is no longer experimental
          - https://discourse.llvm.org/t/proposal-rename-flang-new-to-flang/69462/33
    - OpenFOAM was tested on shinx by researcher
        - with software built for doduo (Zen2), same timings were observed (?!) as with Zen4 optimized build
- new CPU architectures in VSC clusters
    - Ghent: AMD Genoa (Zen4, EPYC 9654) is there (shinx)
    - UA: unclear what's coming next
    - VUB: maybe AMD Genoa X soon
    - KUL: next cluster probably in 2025
    - anyone considering Arm CPUs?
        - NVIDIA Grace was quite expensive when UGent last looked at it
        - also some uncertainty with suppport for GPFS
        - GPU drivers + CUDA is OK
- VUB deliberately skipped 2022b toolchains
    - all new installations were done with 2023a
    - users don't really demand specific toolchains
    - KUL has also been skipping toolchain versions regularly
        - downside is that effort is sometimes needed to port easyconfigs to toolchains being used
- OpenMPI 5.0 release
    - not yet for 2023b, maybe also not yet for 2024a
    - OpenMPI 5.0 is mostly ABI compatible with OpenMPI 4.x, see https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/v5.0.x/version-numbering.html#open-mpi-ompi-series-abi-compatibility
