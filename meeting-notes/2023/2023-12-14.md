# Sync meeting 2023-12-14 (09:00 CEST)

### Agenda

- EB hook for setting optarch in Hydra https://github.com/vub-hpc/eb_hooks/blob/ffda61bea53560b7a3b2bd3f50c125c0d28dda39/lib/vsc/eb_hooks/hooks_hydra.py#L100
    - fixes issue https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/issues/3793

- Initial experiences with easybuilding for AMD GPUs (ROCm)
    - still in its infancy: linking to system libs, outdated packages, need to target OpenMPI v5
    - goal is to get GROMACS, TF and PyTorch on ROCm
    - PyTorch v2 is actively moving to support ROCm (v5.7+ needed)
    - In Vaughan software deployed from containers of InfinityHub (AMD)

- Easyconfigs for iCommands+iRODS installation on Hortense: https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/pull/244
    - build with Clang v15
    - RPM also available from upstream repo

- R for 2023a is finally available in EB
    - important change: R easyconfig is minimal, bulk of packages in R-bundle-CRAN
    - PR https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/19170

- Maxime: interest in getting SciPy-bundle working with Intel MKL
    - current development in PR https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/18875
        - a lot of work to avoid/fix failing tests, not so much in the code itself
    - interest for integration with software using Intel (e.g. ASE)
    - also can be beneficial for performance in certain cases
